The largest and fiercest of her species, Rek&apos;Sai is a merciless predator that tunnels through the earth to ambush and devour her prey. Her insatiable hunger has laid waste to entire regions of the once-great Shuriman empire. Merchants, traders and armed caravans will go hundreds of miles out of their way to avoid these vast areas, though cunning bandits have been known to lure the unwary into her killing grounds. Once Rek&apos;Sai detects you, your fate is sealed. There is no hope of escape; she is death from below the sand.
